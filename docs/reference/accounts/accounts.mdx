## Deleting an Account
If you have an account no longer in use and you'd like to delete that account: 

1. Sign in to https://portal.cycle.io.
2. Click on your profile image in the top left of the screen.
3. Click on settings

On the main settings page in the right hand corner near the bottom is a delete account form. You'll be able to remove your account there.
