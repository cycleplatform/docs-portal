### What is the billing cycle?

Billing is set to a 28 day month. This means that you are charged no more or no less for months of different lengths. You will be invoiced and charged on the same day of each month and this will be based on the day that you created the hub.

### When am I charged?

You'll be charged when you place an order, or whenever your order renews. Placing an order means selecting an initial tier/support plan during hub creation, or upgrading your tier during your billing cycle.

### Do I pay Cycle for my infrastructure?

No. You will create an account with your chosen provider(s) and enter all associated credit card information. After this, you will copy the API key given by the provider and post it into Cycle. This will enable you to use Cycle to provision infrastructure without leaving the portal. All billing associated with the provider will be described and collected by that provider and will not be something you receive in an invoice from Cycle.

### What is a tier and what are the differences between them?

Cycle manages billing through licensing tiers. Each tier has an allotment of RAM associated with it, and every server you “connect” to Cycle will count toward this allotment. Any connected RAM over the allotment is charged at the overage price. You can find out more on our pricing page [here.](https://cycle.io/pricing/)

### Is RAM licensing hard capped?

No. Overages give you the ability to scale without having to upgrade to the next tier until it makes sense. See [pricing](https://cycle.io/pricing/) to learn more.
