# Function Containers 
Using the [deployment strategy](/reference/containers/deployment-strategies), `function`, a user can tell Cycle they'd like to create a function type container.  

The container instances exist on the servers they're deployed to. However, a user might think of this type of container as being more similar to a serverless function. 


<div style={{ maxWidth: '100%', position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
    <iframe style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCOHKPGXxAQ?si=8m3ziy_3r4bjg8k6" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>


## Invoking A Function Container
There are two main ways to invoke a function container: 

1. Connect a domain to the container and make a call to the domain. 
2. Use the [scheduler API](https://scheduler-api.docs.cycle.io). 


HTTP initiated functions require the [V1 Load Balancer](/reference/environments/services/loadbalancer/v1) to be configured for the environment.  The V1 load balancer is able to automatically interact with the scheduler to claim, spawn, and release function instances per request to the endpoint.

## Function Configuration
Function containers have their own [configuration options](/reference/containers/configuration/deployment#function) in the container configuration section.
