Container configuration has its own submenu including:

- [Network](/reference/containers/configuration/networking)
- [Runtime](/reference/containers/configuration/runtime)
- [Deployment](/reference/containers/configuration/deployment)
- [Resources](/reference/containers/configuration/resources)
- [Integrations](/reference/containers/configuration/integrations)
- [Auto-Scale](/reference/containers/configuration/autoscaling)

Each of these submenus (other than network) has a configuration form and the option of enabling changes to that form. The "Save Config" button must be used to save changes made to the containers configuration.
