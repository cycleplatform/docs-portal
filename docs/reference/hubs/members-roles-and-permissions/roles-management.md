# Roles Management
Members of a hub that have the capability `Manage Roles` will be able to create, modify, and remove roles from the hub.  

## Modify An Existing Role
To manage an existing role, go to `Hub` from the main navigation and `Roles`.

Updating the role is as simple as changing the fields you'd like to interact with and saving using the `Update Capabilities` button at the bottom of the page. 


## Creating a New Role
To open the create role wizard, navigate to the roles dashboard and click on `Create`.

The form takes 4 fields:

1. Name - a name for the role, not used by platform.
2. Identifier - an identifier used by the platform to find the role resource.
3. Rank - see [rank](/reference/hubs/members-roles-and-permissions/#rank)
4. Capabilities - the list of capabilities members assigned to this role will have (this can be changed in the future). 


You may also notice the option to `Apply Template`.  Applying a template is saying, I'd like to take the [default settings](/reference/hubs/members-roles-and-permissions/default-permissions) and apply them to this roles capabilities as a start. 

Its then up to you to add or remove any capabilities you'd like to complete your new role.  



## Changing Member Roles
To change a members existing role, click on `Hub` from the main navigation and then `Members`.  Locate the `Update Member` form on the right hand side of the screen and select the new role from the `Role` dropdown. Once completed, use the `Update` button to save the new role assignment.
