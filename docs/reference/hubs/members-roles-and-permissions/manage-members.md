# Managing Hub Members

Learn how to add, remove, and control what the members of your hub have access to.

Cycle's simple yet powerful member management puts you in control of who has access to your hubs. Using a role based permission system built on top of a granular list of capabilities, give just the right amount of access to anyone who joins.

All member management is done through the members tab of the hub settings.

### Inviting New Members
After navigating to the members tab of hub settings, locate the "Invite Members" box on the right hand side.


1. Enter the email of the person you wish to invite.
2. Select the [role](/reference/hubs/members-roles-and-permissions/) this person should have in the hub. 
3. Click "Invite". Once your invitation has been sent, you'll receive a notification at the bottom of your screen as confirmation.


:::caution Rank
When you are creating an invite, you can only create a user with a role that is lower in [rank](/reference/hubs/members-roles-and-permissions/#rank) than the role of the user you're logged into.  Example: an admin cannot create other admins.

### Accepting an Invitation
If you receive a Cycle invitation, you can access your invite by navigating to your account settings and clicking "Hubs".

1. Navigate to Account Settings by clicking on the dropdown menu located in the top right of the portal and then click the username.
2. Once in the account settings area, select "Hubs" from the top navigation.
3. Invites are listed in the Hubs section of Account Settings. To accept an invite simply click accept, and the Hub will be added to the Hubs list.


### Removing Members
Using the table on the members page of hub settings, select the accounts you wish to delete. In the dropdown at the bottom of the table, select "Remove selected" and click "Apply". All selected members will be removed from the hub.

:::note
You cannot remove the owner of a hub. The ability to transfer ownership will be coming in a future update. If you need assistance with this, please contact support.
