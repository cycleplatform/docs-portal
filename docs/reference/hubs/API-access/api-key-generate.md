# Managing API Keys
Generate an API key to take powerful programmatic control of the resources in your hub.  

## Creating An API Key
Navigate to the API Key create form:

`settings > API Keys > Create API Key`

Fill in the name, any IP restrictions for the key, and a [role](/reference/hubs/members-roles-and-permissions/#the-parts-of-a-role).

:::danger 
Once you submit the API key create, the key will show one time.  For users that no longer have access to their key, a new key will need to be created.
:::


API Keys now derive their capabilities based on the role they're assigned to.

## Deleting API Keys
Navigate to the API Key settings page: 


`settings > API Keys > <API Key> `


To delete a key simple enter the name in the form on the right hand side of the screen and press the Delete API key button.
