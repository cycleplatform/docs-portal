## Inter-doc link

To reference another page within docs all you have to do is the follow:
```markdown
[Some Link](path/under/docs.md)
```

:::caution

The path will not work if it includes `docs`. It must be the path
within the docs directory.

## External link

Anytime you preface a link with a `https://...` the link is automatically
assumed to be an offsite link.

```markdown
[Some Link](path/under/docs.md)
```
