# Instance Console

The instance console is located on the instance dashboard.

It's important to know what's happening inside your container, especially when it comes to debugging. The portal has a built in console that shows you the output of your instance (stdout & stderr). The instance console has a 40KB buffer, so that even if the process dies, you'll be able to have a history of what happened.
