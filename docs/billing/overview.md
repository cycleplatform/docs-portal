# Billing Overview

A description of Cycle's billing policies.

---

Payment is due when you create your hub. This starts your billing cycle, which is on a 28-day basis. Your card will automatically be charged at the end of the period to avoid service interruption.

All costs are tied to your hub. This way, users can create an account and join hubs without needing to enter a credit card. It also provides flexibility in how you pay for different clouds.

---

## Infrastructure Costs & Cycle License

Your total monthly bill from Cycle will be based on your current live hubs and the tier you selected for them, plus any overages on RAM. The infrastructure you attach to your hub will be billed through your provider and is handled outside of Cycle's billing platform.

---

## IPs

When you deploy a public container Cycle will allocate an IP or set of IP's through your provider.
