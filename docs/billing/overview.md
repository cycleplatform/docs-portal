# Billing Overview

Payment is due upon creation of a hub. This starts the billing cycle, which is on a 28-day basis. 

The provided payment method will automatically be charged at the end of the period to avoid service interruption.

All costs are tied to a hub. This way, users can create an account and join hubs without needing to enter a credit card. It also provides flexibility in how each hub is paid for.



## Infrastructure Costs & Cycle License

Your total monthly bill from Cycle will be based on your current live hubs and the tier you selected for them, plus any overages on RAM. The infrastructure you attach to your hub will be billed through your provider and is handled outside of Cycle's billing platform.

Cycle's main [pricing page](https://cycle.io/pricing) has more information on tiers and monthly costs.
