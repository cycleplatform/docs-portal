:::info Hard and Soft Caps
* **hard cap** - An amount that cannot be exceeded.
* **soft cap** - An amount that can be exceeded but carries a corresponding action.
:::



For the Free tier, all resources are hard capped - as this tier is meant for an individual user just trying out the platform.  The Lite and Business tiers only have hard caps on servers and users, the RAM Pool is a soft cap that can be exceeded.  Overages to the soft cap are covered on the pricing page linked to above.
