# Cycle Guides (Early Release)
The newest addition to the Cycle documentation is Cycle Guides.  These guides will help bridge the gap between Cycle developers and either 3rd party integrations or task specific best practices.


:::note
The `Early Release` tag in this case refers to the amount of current guides available vs the amount of guides planned.  All guides included in the documentation have been tested against the platform at time of writing.

## Contribute A Guide
While we do have plans to open source Cycle's documentation, allowing for adding guides to be as easy as opening a pull request - for now the best way to suggest a guide is to join our [public Slack Channel](https://slack.cycle.io).
