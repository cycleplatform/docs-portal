# Welcome To Guides
Welcome to the guides section of the documentation. 

This section is meant to give users both real world examples of how to accomplish tasks on the platform, as well as technical details on things like external integrations.

We've split guides into two distinct sections: 


1. Tutorials - similar to long form blogs, but much more to the point.  These technical walkthroughs are focused on technical implementations; step by step. 
2. Videos - the videos section, largely supported by our [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/cycleplatform) (please subscribe ðŸ˜Ž), is a collection of hands on walkthroughs in video format.  


We're trying to make sure theres a good mix of both text tutorials and video content so users can choose whichever they'd like when exploring new concepts.  If theres a topic we're missing or a guide you'd love to see please join our [Public Slack](https://slack.cycle.io) and let us know what you'd like to see!
