# Docker Registry Source

Use a Docker registry as the origin of an image source on Cycle.

### Docker Registry Workflow

After navigating to the images dashboard (by clicking on the Images tab in the main nav), click on the Add Image Source button to bring up the create form.

On the create form, simply fill in the Docker Registry details for registry url and image name/tag. If the repo requires auth to pull the image, select the use auth checkbox and enter your username along with a password.
