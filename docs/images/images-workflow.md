# Images Workflow
Container images are atomic copies of a filesystem that are built from a file (ex: Dockerfile).  

On Cycle, users will create an image source - describing where to find image assets - and then import images from that source.  Each imported image is a point in time atomic reference.


## Image Summary

After selecting an image source there will be a list of images that have been created from that source.  Selecting any one of these images will show a summary of image information.

:::note Image Source
Image source will show information relevant to the specific image source type.

### Image Settings
There is also an option to select image settings from the horizontal navigation.  From this page, a user can update the name of the image, see the ID, or delete the image.
