# Images Workflow
Working with Images on Cycle is incredibly simple.  After creating an [image source](https://docs.cycle.io/docs/images/sources/sources-overview), images can be created using the image import button on the image source dashboard.


An **Image** is a point-in-time reference of all the files, layers, and steps needed for to construct and run containers.  Each image created is [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)), in the sense that it is irreducible and will operate in the same way each time it is run.
