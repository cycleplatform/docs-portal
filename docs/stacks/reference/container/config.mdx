# Container Config
The container configuration allows for ultra granular access to network, deployment, runtime, resource, and itegration settings.



## Network Config

| Field    | Type                                  | Required | Nullable | Description      |
|----------|-------------------------------------  |:--------:|:--------:|------------------|
|hostname | String                                 |✅        | ❌       |The container hostname used by Cycle's discovery service for DNS queries. |
|public   | String                                 |✅        | ❌       |the containers network setting for public internet - choices are `enable`, `disable`, `egress-only`. |
|ports    | String                                 |❌        | ❌       |an array of port mappings for the container. |


### Network Config Example
```json
{
  "hostname": "server",
  "public": "enable",
  "ports": ["80:80", "443:80"]
}
```

### Stateful & Instances
The stateful object holds a single key called `instances`.

`stateful table`

| Field    | Type                                  | Required | Nullable | Description      |
|----------|-------------------------------------  |:--------:|:--------:|------------------|
|instances | Array                                 |✅        | ❌       |an array of instance objects which allow for granular control over each instance of a stateful container. |

`instances table`
<InstancesTable />

#### Stateful Instance Match
The instance object describes the instance being targeted in the `match` object.  Currently, for each instance of a stateful container created, Cycle will look at the hostname and prepend a number (starting at 1) separated by a dot.

To match a stateful containers first instance, the user can simply use the hostname value `1.thecontainershostname`.
<MatchTable />


#### Statful Instance Start Commands
`default`, `first`, and `auto` _start_ each have different use cases, but the object shape is consistent between them.
