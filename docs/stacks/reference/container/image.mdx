# Container Image

## Image
| Field    | Type                                  | Required | Nullable | Description      |
|----------|-------------------------------------  |:--------:|:--------:|------------------|
| `name`   | String                                | ❌       | ✅       | The name of the image. |
| `origin` | Object                                | ✅       | ❌       | An object holding information about the image's origin. |

```json
{
  "name": "Image Name",
  "origin": { ... image_origin }
}
```

## Image Origin Object
| Field     | Type   | Required | Nullable | Description      |
|-----------|--------|:--------:|:--------:|------------------|
| `type`    | String | ✅        | ❌      | The type of image origin, can be `docker-file`, `docker-registry`, `docker-hub`, or `cycle`.|
| `details` | Object | ✅        | ❌      | Location, authentication, and meta data about the origin. Object key values are different based on the type defined.  |


### Image Origin Details Object


<ImageOriginDetails />



## Dockerfile Origin Object: Details
The `docker-file` image origin type is incredibly flexible and powerful.

<RepoTable />

### Using The Repo Field
If the stack references an image source, which resides in a different remote git repository, the repo field is used.

<RemoteRepo />

### Using The `targz_url` Field
Some users prefer to host packaged files on an endpoint for their image sources.  If the targz_url is used, it must include the protocol of `http` or `https` along with the full url and endpoint in one string.

Along with that string, a user will provide the context directory and buildfile, unless those two values are root `/` and `/Dockerfile` respectively as it relates to the downloaded package, after being unzipped.

A `docker-file` image source may still rely upon registry credentials to authenticate during image create, if the image being created uses a parent image requiring authentication to download.

A user will NEVER use both the repo object and the targz_url in the same details object.

```json
{
  "type": "docker-file",
  "details": {
    "targz_url": "https://yoururl.com/endpoint",
    "context_dir": "/target/directory",
    "build_file": "/target/directory/Dockerfile",
    "credentials": [
      {
        "url": "privateregistry.io",
        "username": "username",
        "token": "1231-4562-7556"
      },
      {
        "url": "privateregistry2.io",
        "username": "username2",
        "token": "1231-3362-7556"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


</details>



### Context Directory
The context directory field `context_dir`, is used to explicitly state the context to be used during image create.

Using this partial Dockerfile and file tree as an example:
```Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine3.13

COPY ./package*.json ./
```

```bash
.
+-- package.json
+-- package-lock.json
+-- Dockerfile
+-- src
|   +-- index.js
|   +-- otherfile.js
+-- node_modules
```
The context directory that should be targeted in this example is `/`.  This is desirable because the files referenced in the `COPY` command would be correctly found in that context.

If the context directory were to be set to `/src`, Cycle would look inside the source directory when trying to perform the COPY command, which has no files that start with `package` or that end in `.json`.

### Build File
Using that same idea, the build file `build_file` field is the full path to the file that will be used for building the image.  In most cases, this file is named `Dockerfile` but regardless of the name all that is needed is the full path from the root directory to the file itself.

In the above example this would have been: `/Dockerfile`


### Registry Credentials
In some builds, there is a reference to a private image.  Those private images require authentication before the files can be pulled.  In order to facilitate this use the `credentials` field and list all necessary authentication objects needed by the image.

For example, there may be an image hosted on a private Docker registry with the following values:

* The `url` where the registry is hosted is `privateregistry.io`.
* The `username` to use for authentication is `username`.
* The `token` is `1231-5462-7556




```jsx
"credentials": [
  {
    url: "privateregistry.io",
    username: "username",
    token: "1231-4562-7556"
  }
]
```
