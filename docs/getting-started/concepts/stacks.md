# [Stacks](/reference/stacks/)
Stacks offer a powerful way to declaratively manage multiple containers, and their deployments to the Cycle platform. Using stacks, you are able to configure every aspect of your applications ahead of time, save it to your version controlled repo, and have Cycle automate the deployment any time you make a push.

Users can also define environment services, scoped variables, and volumes in the stack file. A full reference for Cycle stacks is available [here](/reference/stacks/reference/)
