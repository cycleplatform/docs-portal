# [Containers](/reference/containers/)
A container, on Cycle, represents the combination of an image and a configuration.  Each copy of that image and configuration is referred to as an [instance](/getting-started/concepts/instances).

The container configuration exposes a large amount of options for users to customize settings such as public network settings, ports, runtime environment variables, resource constraints on CPU and RAM, integrations, and more.
