# [Hubs](/reference/hubs/)
The hub is the highest level resource.  It is directly tied to a tier and it describes the access rights you have for the platform, the number of users, servers, environments, images, etc... All other resources, when created, are a part of a hub.

This resource is denoted by 3 different tiers, each with different license and usage agreements: 

1. Lite
2. Startup 
3. Business 

There is also a free tier, reserved for non-commercial testing of the platform by individual developers or very small teams. 

Only the account with the role of hub `owner` can make changes to the hub tier.

For more information on current tiers and pricing check out our [pricing page](https://cycle.io/pricing).
