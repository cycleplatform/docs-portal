# Main Concepts
Their are two main concepts to be aware of:

1. [Core Services](/getting-started/concepts/services) - This is the set of services we maintain for our users.  Its the SaaS part of our offering, fully managed by Cycle.
2. [Platform Primitives](/getting-started/concepts/primitives) - These are the resource types that can be created and used by the user such as containers, images, environments, and the like.  Each of these primitives is linked to below.
