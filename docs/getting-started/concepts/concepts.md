# Main Concepts
Their are two main concepts to be aware of:

1. [Core Services](/getting-started/concepts/services) - This is the set of services we maintain for our users.  Its the SaaS part of our offering, fully managed by Cycle.
2. Platform Primitives - These are the resource types that can be created and used by the user such as containers, images, environments, and the like.  Each of these primitives is linked to below. 

## Primitives
The Cycle platform exposes several primitives to the user.  This sections hopes to give new users an idea of how these primitives are organized and a pathway to understanding how to user them. 

Beyond this understanding, we'd like users to also know that the goal with Cycle is to be a unified toolset offering full vertical integration in a way that no other container PaaS offers.  So as you learn about these primitives, please keep in mind that a big part of the reason this platform is built the way it is, is to give the user more power without the heavy burden of adding tons more tools, packages, or services to the mix.
