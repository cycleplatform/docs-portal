# [Providers](/reference/infrastructure/providers/)
A provider on Cycle represents either an IaaS provider or an on-prem / colo type integration.  

The IaaS provider integrations come in two flavors: 

1. Native
2. Custom

To support providers we do not have a native integration with Cycle released the ability to create custom integrations with providers that meet the [criteria for integration](https://docs.cycle.io/docs/infrastructure/providers/ial#prerequisite).


Currently the natively supported IaaS providers are: 

* AWS
* Equinix Metal
* GCP 
* Vultr

A provider must be configured before you start provisioning servers.
