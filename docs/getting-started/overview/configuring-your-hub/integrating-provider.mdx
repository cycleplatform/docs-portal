# Integrating A Provider 
With Cycle, you own the infrastructure but in order to add new servers through the portal, you'll need to add provider credentials to your hub.  This will allow Cycle to programmatically create and manage servers on your behalf.  

Steps to add a provider:

1. Navigate to the [portal](https://portal.cycle.io) and log in, then select the hub from your hubs list.  (if you only have one hub this will automatically be selected) 
2. Click on the `Hub` tab in the left-hand navigation bar and then `Integrations`
3. Select the infrastructure provider you'd like to add from the list of available providers and then use the `Add Integration` button to open the provider's configuration modal.


For a guide on how to generate provider specific credentials see the links on this [page](/reference/hubs/integrations/providers#currently-supported-providers)

## Verified?

After the credentials are added, the provider will be verified.  This step makes a preliminary call to the provider through Cycle's API to ensure the credentials are valid.  If the verification fails, there's likely a configuration step thats been missed.  

If you get hung up on this step, please reach out to us through our [Public Slack](https://slack.cycle.io).  Our team is happy to help clear up any confusion or help diagnose problems.
