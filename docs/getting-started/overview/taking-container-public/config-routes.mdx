# Configure Ports And Network

## Prerequisites

* [Configuring Hub](/getting-started/overview/configuring-your-hub)
* [Deploying Your First Container](/getting-started/overview/deploy-first-container/)
* [Configure DNS](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/config-dns)
* [Create A Linked Record](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/linked-record)
* [Start Load Balancer](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/load-balancer)

To recap, we've created a container and then created all the necessary assets for the container to be reachable via public network:

1. A load balancer is online.
2. A linked record is created that points to the container. 

Now, all thats left to do is configure the container so that:

1. Public Network is set to `Enable`
2. Check port mapping


## Enable Public Network 
Head back to the container we've been working with and click on the `Config` tab in the container modal. At the top of the page you'll see a network section and in this section a setting for `Public Network`.  If you've followed the previous steps this will currently say `Disable`.
