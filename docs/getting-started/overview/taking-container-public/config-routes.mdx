# Configure Ports And Network

## Prerequisites

* [Configuring Hub](/getting-started/overview/configuring-your-hub)
* [Deploying Your First Container](/getting-started/overview/deploy-first-container/)
* [Configure DNS](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/config-dns)
* [Create A Linked Record](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/linked-record)
* [Start Load Balancer](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/load-balancer)

To recap, we've created a container and then created all the necessary assets for the container to be reachable via public network:

1. A load balancer is online.
2. A linked record is created that points to the container. 

Now, all thats left to do is configure the container so that:

1. Public Network is set to `Enable`
2. Check port mapping


## Public Network 
Currently the container dashboard should look like this.  

![Network Disable](https://static.cycle.io/portal-docs/containers/network-map/network-disable.png)

This network diagram was designed to help users diagnose what configuration changes should be made in order for the container to have access to public networking 

If you were to hover over the green checkmark, you'd see that it says `Connection between internet and load balancer configured correctly`. So in the previous step where we set up the load balancer, this was enabled.  

**BUT**

If you hover over the crossed out circle you'll see that it says `container network is disabled`.  So let's start by enabling that. 



## Enabling the Public Network

Head back to the container we've been working with and click on the `Config` tab in the container modal. At the top of the page you'll see a network section and in this section a setting for `Public Network`.  If you've followed the previous steps this will currently say `Disable`. 

Select `Enable` from the list and then use the `Save Container` button to save the changes. 

![Port Config](https://static.cycle.io/portal-docs/containers/network-map/no-port.png)

With the public network set to `Enable` the network diagram has updated to show that `the container has no open ports that the load balancer accepts traffic on`.  

Heading back to the container network configuration settings, you should have a ports field with no entries, so this message makes a lot of sense.  Add `80:80` and `443:80` to the ports field and then save the container.

:::success DNS Linked Record
If you skipped the step where we set up a DNS zone and a linked record, you'll have an error in your network diagram.  If you'd like to resolve that just head over to [that step](/getting-started/overview/taking-container-public/config-dns) now and follow along.
