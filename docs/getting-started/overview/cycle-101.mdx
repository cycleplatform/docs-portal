# Cycle 101
A breif introduction to the main concepts that are important when first starting out with Cycle.  


When you first sign up for an [account](/reference/accounts/), you'll be able to create your first [hub](/reference/hubs).  On Cycle, a Hub is more or less representative of a license or a `tier`.

You can see on this page there are three main tiers, `Lite`, `Startup`, and `Business`.  Each of these tiers represents a different monthly licesnse that includes a certain amount of resources, seats, and features included in the license (monthly). There is also an `Enterprise` tier that is custom and can be tailored to your specific needs.

The hub itself doesn't really "do" anything other than represent this space, but its  essential to have a hub set up so that you can start adding things like providers, servers, images, containers, and environments. 

## Providers and Servers 
The first thing you'll want to understand, once you have a hub set up, is how to add a provider and a server.  A provider is (generally) a cloud IaaS provider, and a server is a virtual (or bare metal) machine.  You can add a provider by clicking on on `Infrastructure` and then `Providers` in the left hand navigation, and then clicking the [`Add Provider`](/reference/infrastructure/providers/) button.  Once you've added a provider, you can add a server by clicking on the `Servers` tab in the left hand navigation, and then clicking the [`Add Server`](/reference/infrastructure/servers#add-server) button.


A server being online comes before anything else.  Environments and containers are dependent on having at least 1 server in place so there is somewhere to deploy to, as the server is the actual machine that the container(s) will run on. 

## Images
After provisioning the server (and making sure its online), the next thing to do is create an [image source](/reference/images/sources/) and image so that you can create a [container](/reference/containers). 

An image source is just a place where, as the user, you can define a location that Cycle can reach to pull all information to build your image from.  There are many different types, defined in the reference link above.  Once you have an image source, you can create an image from it.  An image is a snapshot of the files present at the point in time when the image was created.  You can create an image by clicking on the `Images` tab in the left hand navigation, then `Sources` followed by the [`Add Image`](/reference/images) button.


Once you have an image imported and the server online, it's time to create an environment and then deploy a container. 

## Environments and Deploying Your First Container 

If you're in a hurry and want to do this quickly, you can create an environment by clicking on the `Environments` tab in the left hand navigation, and then clicking the [`Add Environment`](/reference/environments) button.  Once you have an environment, you can deploy a container to it by clicking on the `Containers` tab in the left hand navigation, and then clicking the [`Add Container`](/reference/containers) button.

**BUT** 

Theres quite a bit more to learn here if you really want to understand whats going on. 

The envioronment itself represents something similar to a VPC or a network, and this environment will span all of the infrastructure of the cluster you've chosen during creating it.  

So if you have 3 different servers deployed to your cluster (lets say the cluster name is "production"), creating an environment with the `cluster` setting of `production` will create this network (or VPC) between those three servers.  This is important to understand because it means that any container deployed to this environment will be able to communicate with any other container deployed to this environment, regardless of which server they are on.  It's also important to note that adding servers to the cluster will automatically include them in the network (VPC) of the environment and removing them will remove them from the network.

### Services
One of the main paradigms in Cycle are the environment services: [discovery](/reference/environments/services/discovery), [load balancer](/reference/environments/services/loadbalancer), and [VPN](/reference/environments/services/VPN) (with the scheduler coming soon). 

Each of these services come preconfigured to work "out of the box", but can also be further customized to fit specific user needs. 

The load balancer handles all ingress traffic from the public internet to the environment, the discovery service is a localised DNS query resolver, and the VPN container allows for external endpoints to connect into the environment network, securely. 


### Deploy the Container
So the server is online, an image is imported, and an environment created.  Congrats!  You're ready to deploy your first [container](/reference/containers). 

Go to the newly created environment and click on the `Deploy Container` button to open the wizard.  For your first deployment the only settings you'll really need to care about are: 

1. Name - whats the name for my container. 
2. Image - which image do I want to deploy (select `Recent Images` then the first image to use the already imported image from eariler). 

Once these two fields are filled out you can click on `Deploy Container` and the container will be deployed with a single container instance.  

## More Important Tools
Getting a container deployed is relatively straightforward, but there are a few more important tools that you should know about.

### DNS 
Cycle has full featured DNS tooling including zones, record managment, TLS management, and deep integrations between DNS records and Cycle load balancers that uncover very powerful combinations.

:::info Hosted Zones 
Unless you have a specific need that prevents you from using [hosted zones](/reference/DNS/zones/hosted-zones), we recommend using them. 

:::

#### Delegation
One of the first questions that always comes up is "Do I need to change my root nameservers to Cycle to use the DNS Zone functionality?"  The answer is no.  You can [delegate a subdomain](/reference/DNS/zones/hosted-zones#delegating-sub-domains-to-cycle-from-your-domain-management-service) to Cycle and use the DNS Zone functionality without changing your root nameservers.  

This is done by creating a `NS` record at your root nameservers that points to the Cycle nameservers.  This is a very powerful feature that allows you to use the Cycle DNS Zone functionality without changing your root nameservers.


### Linked Records
While many of the records you'd create in a DNS zone will be familiar, Cycle introduces the [linked record](/reference/DNS/records/adding-records#type-linked) which are a special type of record provided by the platform.  These records are tied directly to a  container (or deployment) and alleviate the need to track and manage specific IP addresses. 

When creating linked records you can also select the option to have a TLS certificate assocaited with that record and Cycle will automatically manage the certificate for you.


### Stacks
[Stacks](/reference/stacks) are a way to group containers together and deploy them as a single unit.  This is useful for deploying applications that have multiple components that need to be deployed together.  A stack works by putting a stack file in the root of a repository and then linking that repository to a stack on Cycle.  

Beyond this, you can also think of a stack as a declairitve way to define an environment.  You can define not only the containers but also [scoped variables](/reference/environments/scoped-variables) and environment services. 


### Deployments

</details>

Think of [deployments](/reference/environments/deployments) as a way  to maintain multiple independent versions of their applications within one single environment. Additionally, deployments make it easy to take new versions of your applications live with zero downtime.

What deployments bring to the table is a way to manage versions of "deployments" and traffic together so that users can "point to" the specific version of the application that they want to use without worrying about downtime.  

### Pipelines
Another essential tool in the Cycle platform quiver is [pipelines](/reference/pipelines). 

Pipelines are a way to automate certian tasks on Cycle.  The main use for this is managing deployments.  Check out [this guide](/guides/tutorials/deploy-pipeline) that goes through setting up rainbow deployments using deployments and pipelines.  

Pipelines claim an exclusive lock on a resource to make sure that nothing else touches it during that time.  So while some users may opt into automation through our expressive [API](https://api-docs.cycle.io), others may find that pipelines provide the guaurantees they want to be able to confidently deploy knowing they won't be stepping on their own toes.


## Keep Learning!

This is a quick and dirty intro to Cycle thats meant to expose new users to quite a few of the main building blocks of the platform without overwhelming detail.  

We also have a [primitives](/getting-started/concepts/primitives) section that goes into more detail about the main building blocks of the platform as a list with links to all the reference sections.

Looking for [guides](/guides/intro)? Check out the guides section that has lots of text and video based guides. The main [reference](/reference/intro) section will have the most detailed, technical information about the platform.
