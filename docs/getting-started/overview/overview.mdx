# Welcome to Cycle

## Before You Begin 
There are a few prerequisites for using the platform that need to be taken care of before you can really get going. 


## Creating an Account

<Accounts />

For more detailed informaiton visit the [Accounts Reference](https://docs.cycle.io/reference/accounts)


## Logging In


<p>
There are multiple ways to interact with your Cycle Hub(s):

* Portal 
* API 
* CLI (coming soon)

The most common way is currently using the <a href="https://portal.cycle.io">portal</a>. 
</p>


When loggin in via the portal you'll always use the `https://portal.cycle.io` URL, unless your organization has a custom cluster. In this case you may be required to enter a modified URL to access your portal and hub.
