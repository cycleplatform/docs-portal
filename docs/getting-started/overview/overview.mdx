# Welcome to Cycle

The leading LowOps platform that simplifies hybrid infrastructure management and container orchestration. Empower your team with seamless deployments, enhanced visibility, and effortless control, all while reducing complexity and technical debt.

## Using Getting Started
This section of the documentation is meant to give users quick access to information on common patterns necessary to deploy containers and manage infrastructure.

What you'll notice on the left hand sidebar is a group of different directories, each of which is subdivided into categories.  Within each of these categories are groups of how-to guides that take the user through high level concepts and specific application of steps.  The goal is to provide a clear path to understanding without getting to in the weeds on technical detail.  That being said, we do aim to cover the full depth of technical detail in the [reference](/reference/intro) section of the documentation.

So you can think of the getting started sections as a "how do I do this" more than a "what does this mean".



## Before You Begin 
There are a few prerequisites for using the platform that need to be taken care of before you can really get going. 

### Cycle's Core Services

Cycle consists of several stand-alone services. These services provide all the functionality offered by the platform. Most services listed here are used under the hood by the platform, and users will mostly interact with the platform via the Portal or Public API services.

For real time status reports on all services check out the Official [Status Page](https://status.cycle.io).

### Logging In


<p>
There are multiple ways to interact with your Cycle Hub(s):

* Portal 
* API 
* CLI (coming soon)

The most common way is currently using the <a href="https://portal.cycle.io">portal</a>.

When loggin in via the portal you'll always use the `https://portal.cycle.io` URL, unless your organization has a custom cluster. In this case you may be required to enter a modified URL to access your portal and hub.
