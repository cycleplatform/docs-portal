# Quick Start

Use this guide to get up an running on Cycle by completing the  following steps:


1. [Create An Account](#account-create)
2. [Create A Hub](#hub-create)



## Creating an Account

Navigate to the [Cycle portal](https://portal.cycle.io) and click on "Sign Up".

To complete signup, a user needs to add a valid email address, their name, and a password.  Cycle will send a verification code to the email entered.  Once the account is verified the user can log in and create their fist hub or join an existing hub.


<!-- TODO what will this look like for someone with non hubs? -->



## Hub Create
Once logged into the new account, a hub can be created.

### Hub Name
<HubName />


### Hub Tier
<HubTier />


### Select Provider
<SelectProvider />


### Add API Keys
<AddApiKeys />


### Billing Information
<BillingInfo />

### Deploy
<Deploy />


:::note  Whats A Cluster?
Are you familiar with the concept of an infrastructure cluster?  On Cycle a cluster is a named group (or as we like to say "pool") of resources (the sum of the underlying server's CPU, RAM, and Disk).

## Create An Image Source
Now that the hub has been created and a server is online (give it a few minutes if its not online already) - the next step is to create an image source.

Navigate to the images dashboard by clicking on *Images* in the left hand navigation, then select "Add Image Source" in the top right of the screen.

### Image Source Types

## Create Environment
Now that the hub has been created and a server is online (give it a few minutes if its not online already) - the next step is to create an environment.

An environment is a private network group for your containers, that includes 3 preconfigured services:
1. A Loadbalancer
2. A Discovery service
3. A VPN
