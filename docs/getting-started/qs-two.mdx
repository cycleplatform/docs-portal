# Quick Start

Use this guide to get up an running on Cycle by completing the  following steps:


1. [Create An Account](#account-create)
2. [Create A Hub](#hub-create)



## Creating an Account

Navigate to the [Cycle portal](https://portal.cycle.io) and click on "Sign Up".

To complete signup, a user needs to add a valid email address, their name, and a password.  Cycle will send a verification code to the email entered.  Once the account is verified the user can log in and create their fist hub or join an existing hub.


<!-- TODO what will this look like for someone with non hubs? -->



## Hub Create
Once logged into the new account, a hub can be created.

### Hub Name
<HubName />


### Hub Tier
<HubTier />


### Select Provider
<SelectProvider />


### Add API Keys
<AddApiKeys />


### Billing Information
<BillingInfo />

### Deploy
<Deploy />


:::note  Whats A Cluster?
Are you familiar with the concept of an infrastructure cluster?  On Cycle a cluster is a named group (or as we like to say "pool") of resources (the sum of the underlying server's CPU, RAM, and Disk).
:::


## Create An Image Source
Now that the hub has been created and a server is online (give it a few minutes if its not online already) - the next step is to create an image source.

Navigate to the images dashboard by clicking on *Images* in the left hand navigation, then select "Add Image Source" in the top right of the screen.

For this quick start, the image to use will be the [DockerHub](/docs/images/sources/dockerhub-source) type.  Name the image whatever you'd like and in the **Image Name** field enter `cycleplatform/getting-started`.  The tag can stay as latest, as that is the desired tag for this image.

Click **Create Source** to continue and on the next screen press the **Import Image** button.  The getting started image will import from DockerHub and show in the list of images created from this image source.


## Create Environment
An environment is a private network group for your containers, that includes 3 preconfigured services:
1. A Loadbalancer
2. A Discovery service
3. A VPN

<EnvironmentCreate />


## Deploy A Container
The final step is to deploy a container to your environment.  Cycle's intuitive container deploy wizard makes this a simple task.

From the dashboard of the environment that was just created click on the **Deploy Container** button in the top right of the screen.

### Container Name
<ContainerName />

### State
<ContainerState />

### Initial Instances
<InitialInstances />

### Deployment Strategy
<DeploymentStrategy />

### Tags
<Tags />

### Image Select
<ImageSelect />

In a previous step, the getting-started image was created and imported.  Click the **Recent Imports** box and select that image from the dropdown.

### Network Settings
<NetworkFields />

For the getting started image change the **Public Network** field to **Enabled**.  The hostname and port mappings will be automatically filled in.

Click **Create Container** to continue.

## Starting The Environment
In order for the containers to come online they need to be running.  Also, the two of the service containers will need to be running as well, the load balancer and the discovery container.  To start all of these containers at once, exit the modal after container create by pressing `esc` (or clicking the x in the corner) and then clicking the **Dashboard**
