### Step 1: Name Your Hub

A hub is generally used as a way to show that a space is fully isolated from another.  Naming a hub should reflect that.  For example: SaaS products will generally use the name of the product as the hub name, where as Developement teams completing projects as third party contractors will often times use the client name for some hubs, while using their company name for their main workspace.

### Step 3: Choose a Tier

#### Hub Tier

Hub tiers are how you define how much storage and RAM your hub will need. Each tier is tailored towards a hub size. If you choose a tier with too many resources Cycle will automatically scale your billing to a lower tier at the end of the month. [Click here](https://www.cycle.io) to find out more about tiers.

#### Support

Cycle offers a standard support plan that is included at no additional cost. This includes communication with our team via our portal live chat and access to the Cycle Slack channel. If your business need a Service Level Agreement, that can be selected as well.


### Step 4: Enter Billing Information

_Skipped if you selected free tier._

Enter the credit card information you want to use for this hub. Your card will be charged at the end of your billing cycle, every 28 days.

### Step 5: Add Collaborators and Finalize

Congratulations, your hub has been created! You'll be able to start deploying containers in just a few minutes. The final step is to invite collaborators to your hub, and configure any advanced options.

#### Collaborators

Before you finalize your order you will have a chance to add collaborators to the hub. Cycle makes it easy to add collaborators and describe the type of access you want those users to have in one step. Type in the email address of the person you wish to add and then select their access level from the Role dropdown menu.
