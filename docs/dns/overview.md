# Overview

Discover how to fully manage your domains using Cycle, and how to utilize the new Linked record type.

---

DNS (Domain Name System), in short, is a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resourcs connected to the internet or a private network. It is what allows the translation of a URL, such as http://example.com, to an IP address.

Cycle provides full support for all DNS record types, and introduces it's own record type, "Linked", to facilitate the association of domains with containers.

---

## Connecting Your Domain To Cycle

Your domain will need to be configured to use Cycle's name servers before it can be utilized by your containers. How this is done varies depending on who you purchased your domain from (the registrar). Unfortunately, Cycle cannot modify your name servers at third party registrars on your behalf.
