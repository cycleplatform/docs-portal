## Hub Name

A hub is used as a way to show that a space is fully isolated from another. Naming a hub should reflect that. For example: SaaS products will generally use the name of the product as the hub name, where-as, developement teams completing projects as third party contractors will often times use the client name for some hubs, while using their company name for their main workspace.

## Hub Tier

Hub tiers are how you define how much storage and RAM your hub will need. Each tier is tailored towards a hub size. If you choose a tier with too many resources Cycle will automatically scale your billing to a lower tier at the end of the month. [Click here](https://www.cycle.io) to find out more about tiers.

## Select Provider

On this step simply select the initial provider(s) to be set up for this hub. Every hub must set up at least 1 provider in order to meet the hub create requirements.

## Add API Keys

In order to add a provider to Cycle, certain resources are needed from each provider. On this page the resources needed are listed.

Also, for each provider there is a helpful guide shown on the hub create step where resources are added.
Just click the dropdown under the resource form for any provider to engage with the guide.

## Billing Information

For paid tiers there will be a billing page asking for the user to set a primary payment method.

Enter the credit card information you want to use for this hub. Your card will be charged at the end of your billing cycle, every 28 days.

## Deploy

The final step is to deploy infrastructure. This is the most important step because without running infrastructure there will be no resources available to run containers.

Luckily, with Cycle, this is incredibly simple. Just select a provider from the **Providers** dropdown menu, then select a location for the server.

On the next page add server(s) to your order summary and then click **Deploy This Infrastructure**.

:::success Hold To Deploy
Many buttons in the Cycle portal are "Hold to Use". This means its required that a user hold the click until the circle on the button completes. This is meant to safeguard users from accidentally clicking on things that can drastically change the state of a program or cost money.
