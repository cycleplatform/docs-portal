In order to add a provider to Cycle, certain resources are needed from each provider. On [this page](https://docs.cycle.io/docs/infrastructure/providers/adding-providers) the resources needed are listed.

Also, for each provider there is a helpful guide shown on the hub create step where resources are added.
Just click the dropdown under the resource form for any provider to engage with the guide.
