Adding a provider is a simple process and allows the user to fully manage their infrastructure through Cycle.

- Navigate to the infrastructure dashboard by selecting Infrastructure from the main left-hand navigation.
- Next select the Providers tab from the top nav.
- Select The Add Provider button at the top right of the screen.
- Pick the provider of your choice from the dropdown and add credentials.
- Click the Verify button to verify the credentials are correct.

### Currently Supported Providers

Cycle currently supports the following providers:

- [Vultr](/reference/infrastructure/providers/configure-vultr)
- [Equinix-Metal](/reference/infrastructure/providers/configure-equinix)
- [AWS](/reference/infrastructure/providers/configure-aws)
- [GCP](/reference/infrastructure/providers/configure-gcp)

### Auxillary Native Providers

To set up an Auxillary native provider, or, more simply, to add another account of the types natively supported, users can select the `Abstraction / Custom Integration` provider with the following special `base_url`.

The supported base url's are:

- `aws`
- `equinix-metal`
- `vultr`
- `gcp`

Alongside these base url's, the user will also need to provide the respective API key, secret, config, or whatever that provider requires.
