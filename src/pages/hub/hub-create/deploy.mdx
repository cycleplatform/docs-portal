The final step is to deploy infrastructure.  This is the most important step because without running infrastructure there will be no resources available to run containers.

Luckily, with Cycle, this is incredibly simple.  Just select a provider from the **Providers** dropdown menu, then select a location for the server.

On the next page add server(s) to your order summary and then click **Deploy This Infrastructure**.

Many buttons in the Cycle portal are "Hold to Use".  This means its required that a user hold the click until the circle on the button completes.  This is meant to safeguard users from accidentally clicking on things that can drastically change the state of a program or cost money.
