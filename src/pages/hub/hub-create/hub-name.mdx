A hub is used as a way to show that a space is fully isolated from another.  Naming a hub should reflect that.  For example: SaaS products will generally use the name of the product as the hub name, where-as, developement teams completing projects as third party contractors will often times use the client name for some hubs, while using their company name for their main workspace.
