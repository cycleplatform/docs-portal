The network fields describe the network settings preferred for the container instances.

#### Public Network

There are three types of network privilege a container can have:

- **Disabled** - Public internet access is completely disabled for this container. It may only communicate with other containers within the same environment. This is ideal for sensitive things, such as databases.
- **Egress Only** - The container may initiate connections over the internet, but all incoming connections will be blocked. This is ideal for things that require fetching data from the web, but do not need to respond to inbound requests, such as web scrapers.
- **Enabled** - The container is able to both start and accept connections over the internet. This is a must for websites, APIs, and other services where clients may not be known ahead of time.

#### Hostname

The hostname is the string that all other containers within the same environment can refer to it by. It must be lowercase, and only contain letters, numbers, and hyphens.
