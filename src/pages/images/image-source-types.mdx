There are currently 3 types of image sources supported.

1. **Docker Hub** - create an image source from an existing image repo on Docker Hub.
2. **Docker Registry** - create an image source from an existing image repo on a private Docker registry, with support for other registry types coming very soon!
3. **Docker File** - create an image source from a repository hosted on any git solution (private or public) by adding a Dockerfile to your repo and telling Cycle where its located.
