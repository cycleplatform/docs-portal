:::note Global Vs. Single
The start and stop container(s) button can start both "all" containers in an environment and a single container depending on the current scope.  If you are in a container modal, the start and stop will start and stop the specific container displayed in that modal.  Outside of the modal, the start and stop acts as a global environment start and stop and will effect all containers in the environment.
