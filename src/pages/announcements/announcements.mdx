| Severe   | A Severe priority announcement is used for major outages affecting a wide range of users.                                                                                              |
| High     | A High priority announcement is used for minor outages affecting smaller groups of users.                                                                                              |
| Medium   | A Medium priority announcement is used for things that could affect a user if not know such as a vendors having trouble with their provisioning API.                                   |
| Low      | A Low priority announcement is used for anything that our users need to be informed of, but that will most likely not have a major impact on uptime.                                   |
| Notice   | A Notice priority announcement would be used to inform our users of something that is happening in the near future that should be considered when making plans for future deployments. |
